// 1) The kubernetes api packages are too heavy.
// 2) We want to make the interface independent with kubernetes api change.

// Severity is the severity of the problem event. Now we only have 2 severity levels: Info and Warn,
// which are corresponding to the current kubernetes event types. We may want to add more severity
// levels in the future.
