# The build rule builds a Docker image that logs all Docker contains logs to
# Google Compute Platform using the Cloud Logging API.

# Procedure for change:
# 1. Bump the tag number.
# 2. Push to the private repo and test using newer version
# 3. Issue PR.
# 4. Assuming permissions to do so, when PR is approved
#    make the gcr.io version of the image: make build push
# 5. Issue PR with config files changes
