INTRODUCTION
============
This is an nginx webserver for simple loadbalancer testing. It works well
for me but it might not have some of the features you want. If you would
like, please extend the code and send me the patch. The servers runs
nginx compiled with ngx_lua; its configration lies at
/usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf. Ways to start it:
* kubectl create -f kube-contrib/nginx-app.yaml
* docker run -it -p 8082:80 bprashanth/nginxtest:1.0

ENDPOINTS
=========
 <a href="hostname">hostname</a>: An endpoint to query the hostname.
 <a href="stress">stress</a>: An endpoint to stress the host.
 <a href="fs/index.html">fs</a>: A file system for static content.

PROFILING
=========
You can stress this container via apache bench:
<b>docker run jordi/ab ab -kc 10000 -n 10000 http://foo/images/nginx.jpg</b>

This should produce results:
Concurrency Level:      1000
Time taken for tests:   30.131674 seconds
Complete requests:      10000
Failed requests:        0
Write errors:           0
Requests per second:    331.88 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       3013.167 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       3.013 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)

One would typically replace foo/images/nginx.jpg with the stress endpoint
to simulate noisy neighbors. Eg:
<b>docker run jordi/ab ab -kc 10000 -n 10000 http://foo/stress?cpu=1&w=3&bytes=100M&timeout=2</b>

This will stress a single core with 3 workers each spinning on malloc
free of 100M for 2s. You should be able to observe this in the profile.

Note that the "size" arg may be suffixed with B,K,M,G (bytes), and you
almost always want to, because a stress test in bytes isn't much of a
stress test. However the timeout parameter is always in seconds. Do
not specify 1s, the trailing "s" will flip the profiling tool into
strictly secure mode.

FILESYSTEM
==========
Nginx will serve static content places anywhere under the /siteroot/fs
heirarchy. A cron job runs every minute generating index.html files for
subdirectories, so you can just place files and have them served via
http endpoints. This feature has only been lightly tested and is meant
to be used in conjunction with the profiling utilities to measure qps.

HOSTNAME
========
Writes the results of `hostname` into the http response. Obviously in
the case of a container/pod this will be a cryptic hash, not the node's
hostname. Meant for use in testing loadbalancing algorithms.

LIMITATIONS
===========
There's some fishy business going on with the TERM env var that sometimes
prevents top from working properly, so the profiling during a stress run
might not always work.
