# Dropin for docker.service

[Unit]
# Flannel must be started before Docker.
# Flannel acquires subnet for the host and writes appropriate
# configuration in /run/flannel_docker_opts.env that is being read
# by Docker service.
# See https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/deploy-master.html
# and https://github.com/coreos/flannel/issues/112#issuecomment-72708347
