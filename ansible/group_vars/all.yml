# This value determines how kubernetes binaries, config files, and service
# files are loaded onto the target machines.  The following are the only
# valid options:
#
# localBuild - requires make release to have been run to build local binaries
# packageManager - will install packages from your distribution using yum/dnf/apt
source_type: packageManager

# os - docker packages will come from the default OS repositories
# docker - will put down docker repo files in yum.repos.d and install latest
docker_provider: os

# will be used as the Internal dns domain name if DNS is enabled. Services
# will be discoverable under <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.<domainname>, e.g.
# myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
cluster_name: cluster.local

# Account name of remote user. Ansible will use this user account to ssh into
# the managed machines. The user must be able to use sudo without asking
# for password unless ansible_sudo_pass is set
#ansible_ssh_user: centos

# password for the ansible_ssh_user. If this is unset you will need to set up
# ssh keys so a password is not needed.
#ansible_ssh_pass: password

# If a password is needed to sudo to root that password must be set here

# Kubernetes internal network for services.
# Kubernetes services will get fake IP addresses from this range.
# This range must not conflict with anything in your infrastructure. These

# Flannel internal network (optional). When flannel is used, it will assign IP

# This network must be unused in your network infrastructure!
flannel_subnet: 172.16.0.0

# Flannel internal network total size (optional). This is the prefix of the

# unused in your environment.
flannel_prefix: 12

# Flannel internal network (optional). This is the size allocation that flannel
