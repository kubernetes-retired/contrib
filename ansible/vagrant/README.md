## Welcome to the Vagrant Deployer for Kubernetes Ansible

This deployer sets-up a Kubernetes cluster on Vagrant.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and clone the contrib repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib.git
```

[Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) if it's not currently installed on your system.

You will need a functioning [vagrant provider](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/). Currently supported providers are openstack, libvirt, and virtualbox. Vagrant comes with VirtualBox support by default. No matter what provider you choose, you need to install the OpenStack and aws Vagrant plugins:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-openstack-provider --plugin-version ">= 0.6.1"
vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws --plugin-version ">= 0.7.2"
```

Vagrant uses Ansible to automate the Kubernetes deployment. Install Ansible (Mac OSX example):
```
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible==2.0.0.2
```

Reference [Ansible installation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) for additional installation instructions.

The DNS kubernetes-addon requires python-netaddr. Install netaddr (Mac OSX example):

```
sudo pip install netaddr
```

Reference the [python-netaddr documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/netaddr/installation.html) for additional installation instructions.

### Fedora

When running the ``vagrant`` on Fedora (tested on F24) don't forget to install necessary dependencies:

```
dnf install -y ruby-devel gcc redhat-rpm-config
```

When provisioning VMs with libvirt provider, don't forget to install ``vagrant-libvirt``:

```
dnf install -y vagrant-libvirt
```

If you hit the ``Error while creating domain: Error saving the server: Call to virDomainDefineXML failed: invalid argument: could not find capabilities for domaintype=kvm `` error message, enable virtualization in BIOS [1], [2].

## Caveats

Vagrant (1.7.x) does not properly select a provider. You will need to manually specify the provider. Refer to the Provider Specific Information section for using the proper `vagrant up` command.

Vagrant prior version 1.8.0 doesn't write group variables into Ansible inventory file, which is required for using Core OS images.

## Usage

You can change some aspects of configuration using environment variables.
Note that these variables should be set for all vagrant commands invocations,
`vagrant up`, `vagrant provision`, `vagrant destroy`, etc.

### Configure number of nodes

If you export an env variable such as
```
export NUM_NODES=4
```

The system will create that number of nodes. Default is 2.

### Configure OS to use

You can specify which OS image to use on hosts:

```
export OS_IMAGE=centos7
```

By default CentOS 7 image is used.

Supported images:

* `centos7` (default) - CentOS 7 supported on OpenStack, VirtualBox, Libvirt providers.
* `coreos` - [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) supported on VirtualBox provider.
* `fedora` - supported at least on Libvirt provider
* `ubuntu14` - supported on Libvirt provider, based on Ubuntu-14.04
* `ubuntu16` - supported on Libvirt provider, based on Ubuntu-16.04

### Start your cluster

If you are not running Vagrant 1.7.x or older, then change to the vagrant directory and `vagrant up`:

```
vagrant up
```


Vagrant up should complete with a successful Ansible playbook run:
```
....

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
kube-master-1              : ok=266  changed=78   unreachable=0    failed=0
kube-node-1                : ok=129  changed=39   unreachable=0    failed=0
kube-node-2                : ok=128  changed=39   unreachable=0    failed=0
```

Login to the Kubernetes master:
```
vagrant ssh kube-master-1
```

Verify the Kubernetes cluster is up:
```
[vagrant@kube-master-1 ~]$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at http://localhost:8080
Elasticsearch is running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/elasticsearch-logging
Heapster is running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster
Kibana is running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kibana-logging
KubeDNS is running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns
Grafana is running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-grafana
InfluxDB is running at http://localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-influxdb

[vagrant@kube-master-1 ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME          LABELS                               STATUS    AGE
kube-node-1   kubernetes.io/hostname=kube-node-1   Ready     34m
kube-node-2   kubernetes.io/hostname=kube-node-2   Ready     34m
```

Make sure the STATUS shows Ready for each node. You are now ready to deploy Kubernetes resources. Try one of the [examples](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/examples) from the Kubernetes project repo.

## Provider Specific Information
Vagrant tries to be intelligent and pick the first provider supported by your installation. If you want to specify a provider you can do so by running vagrant like so:
```
# virtualbox provider
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

# openstack provider
vagrant up --provider=openstack

# libvirt provider
vagrant up --provider=libvirt
```

### OpenStack
Make sure you installed the openstack provider for vagrant.
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-openstack-provider --plugin-version ">= 0.6.1"
```
NOTE This is a more up-to-date provider than the similar  `vagrant-openstack-plugin`.

Also note that current (required) versions of `vagrant-openstack-provider` are not compatible with ruby 2.2.
https://github.com/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider/pull/237
So make sure you get at least version 0.6.1.

To use the vagrant openstack provider you will need
- Copy `openstack_config.yml.example` to `openstack_config.yml`
- Edit `openstack_config.yml` to include your relevant details.

###### Libvirt

The libvirt vagrant provider is non-deterministic when launching VMs. This is a problem as we need ansible to only run after all of the VMs are running. To solve this when using libvirt one must
do the following
```
vagrant up --no-provision
vagrant provision
```

### VirtualBox
Nothing special should be required for the VirtualBox provisioner. `vagrant up --provider virtualbox` should just work.


## Additional Information
If you just want to update the binaries on your systems (either pkgManager or localBuild) you can do so using the ansible binary-update tag. To do so with vagrant provision you would need to run
```
ANSIBLE_TAGS="binary-update" vagrant provision
```

### Running Ansible

After provisioning a cluster vith Vagrant you can run ansible in this directory for any additional provisioning -
`ansible.cfg` provides configuration that will allow Ansible to connect to managed hosts.

For example:

```
$ ansible -m setup kube-master-1
kube-master-1 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [
            "172.28.128.21",
            "10.0.2.15"
        ],
...
```
