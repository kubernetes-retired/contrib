# This Dockerfile will build an image that is configured to use Fluentd to
# collect container log files from the specified paths and send them to the
# Google Cloud Logging API.
# The environment variable that controls which log files are collected is
# FILES_TO_COLLECT. Files specified in the environment variable should be
# separated by whitespace, as in "/var/log/syslog /var/log/nginx/access.log".
# This configuration assumes that the host performing the collection is a VM
# that has been created with a logging.write scope and that the Logging API
# has been enabled for the project in the Google Developer Console.
