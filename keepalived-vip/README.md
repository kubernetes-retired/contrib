# kube-keepalived-vip
Kubernetes Virtual IP address/es using [keepalived](http://www.keepalived.org)

AKA "how to set up virtual IP addresses in kubernetes using [IPVS - The Linux Virtual Server Project](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/software/ipvs.html)".


## Overview

There are 2 ways to expose a service in the current kubernetes service model:

- Create a cloud load balancer.
- Allocate a port (the same port) on every node in your cluster and proxy traffic through that port to the endpoints.

This just works. What's the issue then? 

The issue is that it does not provide High Availability because beforehand is required to know the IP addresss of the node where is running and in case of a failure the pod can be be moved to a different node. Here is where ipvs could help. 
The idea is to define an IP address per service to expose it outside the Kubernetes cluster and use vrrp to announce this "mapping" in the local network.
With 2 or more instance of the pod running in the cluster is possible to provide high availabity using a single IP address.

##### What is the difference between this and [service-loadbalancer](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/service-loadbalancer) or [nginx-alpha](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/Ingress/controllers/nginx-alpha) to expose one or more services?

This should be considered a complement, not a replacement for HAProxy or nginx. The goal using keepalived is to provide high availability and to bring certainty about how an exposed service can be reached (beforehand we know the ip address independently of the node where is running). For instance keepalived can use used to expose the service-loadbalancer or nginx ingress controller in the LAN using one IP address.


## Requirements

[Daemonsets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/daemon.md) enabled is the only requirement. Check this [guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/api.md#enabling-resources-in-the-extensions-group) with the required flags in kube-apiserver.


## Configuration

To expose one or more services use the flag `services-configmap`. The format of the data is: `external IP -> namespace/serviceName`. Optionally is possible to specify forwarding method using `:` after the service name. The valid options are `NAT` and `DR`. For instance `external IP -> namespace/serviceName:DR`.
By default if the method is not specified it will use NAT.

This IP must be routable inside the LAN and must be available. 
By default the IP address of the pods are used to route the traffic. This means that is one pod dies or a new one is created by a scale event the keepalived configuration file will be updated and reloaded.

## Example

First we create a new replication controller and service
```
$ kubectl create -f examples/echoheaders.yaml
replicationcontroller "echoheaders" created
You have exposed your service on an external port on all nodes in your
cluster.  If you want to expose this service to the external internet, you may
need to set up firewall rules for the service port(s) (tcp:30302) to serve traffic.

See http://releases.k8s.io/HEAD/docs/user-guide/services-firewalls.md for more details.
service "echoheaders" created
```

Next add the required annotation to expose the service using a local IP

```
$ echo "apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: vip-configmap
data:
  10.4.0.50: default/echoheaders" | kubectl create -f -
```

Now the creation of the daemonset
```
$ kubectl create -f vip-daemonset.yaml
daemonset "kube-keepalived-vip" created
$ kubectl get daemonset
NAME                  CONTAINER(S)          IMAGE(S)                         SELECTOR                        NODE-SELECTOR
kube-keepalived-vip   kube-keepalived-vip   gcr.io/google_containers/kube-keepalived-vip:0.10   name in (kube-keepalived-vip)   type=worker
```

**Note: the daemonset yaml file contains a node selector. This is not required, is just an example to show how is possible to limit the nodes where keepalived can run**

To verify if everything is working we should check if a `kube-keepalived-vip` pod is in each node of the cluster
```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       LABELS                                        STATUS    AGE

10.4.0.5   kubernetes.io/hostname=10.4.0.5,type=worker   Ready     1d
```

```
$ kubectl get pods

```

```

Scaling the replication controller should update and reload keepalived

```
$ kubectl scale --replicas=5 replicationcontroller echoheaders
replicationcontroller "echoheaders" scaled
```

## PROXY Protocol mode

The [PROXY Protocol](http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.6/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) allows the transport connection information such as a client's address across multiple layers of NAT or TCP. Usually this is information is lost, containing information about the last hop.
There is only one caveat using this protocol: the destination must "understand" the protocol. Without this is not possible to read the traffic.
To enable this feature the flag `--proxy-protocol-mode=true` is required.

**Using this flag implies that HAProxy will be responsible of handling the load balancing in TCP mode**

[HAProxy](http://haproxy.1wt.eu) is used to in conjunction win Keepalived so send proxy packets.


Example:

First create a configmap with the VIP mapping
```
echo "apiVersion: v1
data:
  10.4.0.50: default/nginx-ingress-lb:PROXY
  10.4.0.51: default/echoheaders
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: vip-configmap
  namespace: default" | kubectl create -f -
```

Where `default/nginx-ingress-lb` is a [NGINX Ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx) with the option `use-proxy-protocol:true`.

The Ingress controller just have one rule using the [echoheaders]() container.
```
old-mbp:~ aledbf$ kubectl get ing
NAME             RULE          BACKEND   ADDRESS         AGE
default-server   -                       10.4.0.5        1d

                 /             echoheaders-x:80
```

```
kubectl create -f vip-daemonser-proxy.xml
```

Finally test the content of the header `x-forwarded-for` to verify it returns the IP address of the client

```
$ curl -v http://10.4.0.50
curl 10.4.0.50
CLIENT VALUES:
client_address=10.2.0.186
command=GET
real path=/
query=nil
request_version=1.1
request_uri=http://10.4.0.50:8080/

SERVER VALUES:
server_version=nginx: 1.9.7 - lua: 9019

HEADERS RECEIVED:
accept=*/*
connection=close
host=10.4.0.50
user-agent=curl/7.43.0
x-forwarded-for=10.4.0.148
x-forwarded-host=10.4.0.50
x-forwarded-port=80
x-forwarded-proto=http
x-real-ip=10.4.0.148
BODY:

```
